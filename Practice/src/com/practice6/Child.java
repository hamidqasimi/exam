//		
//		Create an Interface ‘Shape’ with undefined methods as calculateArea and calculatePerimiter .
//		Create 2 child classes: Circle & Square that should have an implementation of area and perimeter calculation. Test your code.
//		We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B.
//		Create class ‘Marks’ with an abstract method ‘getPercentage’. It is inherited by classes ‘A’ and ‘B’ each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students.
//		The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Test your code
//		Create Registration Class in which you would have variables as email, userName and password that have an access scope only within its own class.
//		After creating an object of the class user should be able to call methods and in each method separately pass values to set users email, username and password. 
//		Requirements: 
//
//		Valid email consider to be only gmail
//		Valid userName and password cannot be empty and should be of length larger than 6 characters. Also valid password cannot contain userName.
//
//		4. Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and color and method calculateSalePrice() which should be returning a price of the car.
//		Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has field as weight and has its own implementation of  calculateSalePrice() method in which returned price calculated as following:
//			if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20% discount.
//		The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own implementation of calculateSalePrice():
//			if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
